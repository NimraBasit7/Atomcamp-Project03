# Atomcamp-Project03
This repository contains the project submission for Atomcamp DS &amp; AI related to Machine Learning. 

Part 1: Regression on Student Performance Dataset
The objective of this task is to predict students’ math scores based on various demographic and academic features. The project includes:

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

- Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant predictors and generating polynomial features.

- Model Building: Training and evaluating both Multilinear and Polynomial Regression models.

- Model Evaluation: Using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score to assess model performance and compare both approaches.

Part 2: Classification on Social Network Ads Dataset
The second part involves predicting whether a user purchases a product based on their age and estimated salary using various classification algorithms:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Dropping unnecessary features, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

- Model Building: Implementing Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (k=3, 5, 7), and Decision Tree classifiers (Gini and Entropy).

- Model Evaluation: Assessing models with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

- Visualization: Decision boundaries plotted for visual interpretation of model behavior.
